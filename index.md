## About Me

**I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student in Economics at Boston University.** 
My research interests include real estate, industrial organization, and household finance. I study the behaviors of households, real estate developers, and investors in the housing markets using empirical and structural methods. I received a B.A. in Economics from the University of Minnesota and an M.A. from the University of Chicago.
