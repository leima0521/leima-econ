## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Boston University. In Fall 2025, I will join the University of Georgia Terry College of Business as an Assistant Professor of Real Estate in August 2025.

<!-- My research interests include real estate, industrial organization, urban economics, and household finance.  -->
I work on questions in housing, urban economics, and household finance using tools from empirical industrial organization and applied micro. Please feel free to reach out anytime if you'd like to discuss research. You can view my CV [here](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf). 

<!-- I study the behaviors of households, real estate developers, and investors in the housing markets using empirical and structural methods. -->
