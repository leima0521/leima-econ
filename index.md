## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Real Estate at the University of Georgia Terry College of Business. I received my Ph.D. in economics from Boston University in 2025.

<!-- My research interests include real estate, industrial organization, urban economics, and household finance.  -->
I work on questions in housing, urban economics, and household finance using tools from empirical industrial organization and applied micro. Please feel free to reach out anytime if you'd like to discuss research. You can view my CV [here](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf). 

<!-- I study the behaviors of households, real estate developers, and investors in the housing markets using empirical and structural methods. -->
