    title: Racial disparities in home selling
    authors: with Leonel Diego Drukker.
    draft: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4736956
    abstract: "In this study, we investigate the financial disparities faced by black sellers in the US housing market. Using repeat-sale transactions from 2003 to 2020, we document that black sellers earn, on average, 0.36% lower annualized unlevered returns on their property sales compared to non-black sellers, when selling comparable properties at the same time in the same neighborhood. We find that the racial disparities in housing returns are not explained by seller characteristics, property renovations, the race of the buyer, seller agent fixed effects, and appraisal measures. However, controlling for listing prices and time on market reduces the racial gap to effectively zero. This suggests that black sellers face higher search frictions, which leads to worse selling outcomes."

    title: Corporate landlords in the single-family rental market
    authors: (Draft coming soon!)
    abstract: "Since 2012, institutional buy-to-rent (B2R) investors have entered the single-family rental market, converting a substantial number of homes into rental properties. This study examines the impact of B2R investors on local housing markets, providing reduced-form evidence on the size and origin of spillover effects resulting from their presence. An additional property by B2R investors within 150 meters increases housing price growth by 2-3%. The impact is stronger in neighborhoods with a black majority and lower property values. The local spillover effects are mostly driven by positive amenity and diminishing supply channels."
