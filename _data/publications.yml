    title: Racial disparities in home selling
    authors: with Leonel Diego Drukker (Draft coming soon!)
    abstract: "Using the universe of property transaction data in the US from 2010-2020, we document that black households receive 0.6-1.1% lower annualized unlevered returns to housing relative to non-black households upon selling their homes. We investigate where this gap comes from and find that neither buyer characteristics nor seller individual or house characteristics explain the gap. Additionally, the gap is consistently larger for households identified as black-only than for households identified as black which includes mixed-race households. We find that measures of appraisals do not explain the gap and neither do real estate agent and broker fixed effects. We document that black sellers list their homes at lower prices, but experience longer time-on-market. We conclude that the large selling gap is primarily due to search frictions faced by black sellers."

    title: Corporate landlords in the single-family rental market
    authors: (Draft coming soon!)
    abstract: "Since 2012, institutional buy-to-rent (B2R) investors have entered the single-family rental market, converting a substantial number of homes into rental properties. This study examines the impact of B2R investors on local housing markets, providing reduced-form evidence on the size and origin of spillover effects resulting from their presence. An additional property by B2R investors within 150 meters increases housing price growth by 2-3%. The impact is stronger in neighborhoods with a black majority and lower property values. The local spillover effects are mostly driven by positive amenity and diminishing supply channels."
